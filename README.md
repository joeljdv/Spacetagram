# Spacetagram

This Is my Spacetagram app, the app fetch data from NASA's APOD API. The app fetch the data and renders the title, date, and the image with a like button in the shape of a heart which changes from black to red color when clicked. The app is made to only show the images from 2021-08-20 to 2021-09-20. I would have liked to add to add date-picker so that the users had access to more images but I was short on time.

When the app starts the user will see a message to wait a moment while the images load and random cat fact under it. The user also has the ability to remove the like from the image. When an user likes an image the heart button will turn red indicating the user has liked that image, if the user click the button again, it will turn back to black indicating the user removed their like.
